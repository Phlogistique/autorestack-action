# End-to-End Test for the update-pr-stack Action
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This test validates the full functionality of the update-pr-stack GitHub
# Action, which automatically updates stacked PRs after a base PR is merged.
#
# WARNING: This test creates and deletes a REAL GitHub repository.
# It requires a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable with appropriate permissions:
# repo (full control), workflow, pull_request (write).
#
# =============================================================================
# TEST SCENARIOS
# =============================================================================
#
# SCENARIO 0: Diff Pollution Test (without action)
# -------------------------------------------------
# Proves that without the action, PR diffs become polluted when the base
# branch is deleted and GitHub auto-retargets to main.
#
# Setup:
#   - Enable "auto-delete head branches" repo setting
#   - Create 2-PR stack: main <- noact_feature1 <- noact_feature2
#   - Each PR modifies a different line (3 and 4)
#
# Test:
#   - Capture noact_feature2's initial diff (shows only its own 1-line change)
#   - Merge noact_feature1 (GitHub auto-deletes branch and retargets PR2 to main)
#   - Verify noact_feature2's diff is NOW POLLUTED (shows accumulated changes)
#
# Then disables auto-delete and installs the action for subsequent scenarios.
#
# SCENARIO 1: Nominal Linear Stack with Clean Merges (Steps 4-7)
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Tests the happy path where PRs are merged without conflicts.
#
# Setup:
#   - Create a stack of 4 PRs: main <- feature1 <- feature2 <- feature3 <- feature4
#   - Each PR modifies line 2 (shared, accumulates) plus a unique line (3, 4, 5)
#
# Action Trigger:
#   - Squash merge PR1 (feature1) into main
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - The action should detect that PR2 (feature2) was based on feature1
#   - Update PR2's base branch from feature1 to main
#   - Merge main into feature2 to incorporate the squash commit
#   - Propagate the merge to feature3 and feature4 as well
#   - Delete the merged branch (feature1)
#
# Verifications:
#   - feature1 branch is deleted from remote
#   - PR2 base branch is updated from feature1 to main
#   - PR3 base branch remains feature2 (only direct children are updated)
#   - feature2, feature3, and feature4 branches contain the squash merge commit
#   - PR diffs are IDENTICAL before and after (action preserves incremental diffs)
#
# SCENARIO 2: Conflict Handling (Steps 8-13)
# ------------------------------------------
# Tests the action's behavior when a merge conflict occurs.
#
# Setup:
#   - After Scenario 1, modify line 7 on feature3 and push
#   - Also modify line 7 on main with different content (creating a conflict)
#   - feature4 (grandchild) exists based on feature3
#
# Action Trigger:
#   - Squash merge PR2 (feature2) into main
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - The action attempts to merge main into feature3
#   - Detects a merge conflict (both modified line 7 differently)
#   - Does NOT push any conflicted state to the remote
#   - Posts a comment on PR3 explaining the conflict
#   - Adds a label "autorestack-needs-conflict-resolution" to PR3
#   - Does NOT update PR3's base branch (keeps it as feature2 for readable diff)
#   - Does NOT delete feature2 branch (still referenced by conflicted PR)
#   - Exits with success (conflict is handled gracefully, not a failure)
#
# Verifications:
#   - feature2 branch is NOT deleted from remote (still referenced by conflicted PR3)
#   - PR3 base branch stays as feature2 (not updated to main)
#   - Conflict comment exists on PR3
#   - Conflict label "autorestack-needs-conflict-resolution" exists on PR3
#   - feature3 branch was NOT updated (still at pre-conflict SHA)
#
# Manual Conflict Resolution (Steps 12-15):
#   - Test simulates user resolving the conflict manually
#   - Merge main into feature3, resolve conflict (keep feature3's changes)
#   - Push the resolved branch
#   - The push triggers the 'synchronize' event on PR3
#   - The action detects the conflict label and removes it
#   - Updates PR3's base branch to main
#   - Deletes feature2 branch (no other conflicted PRs depend on it)
#   - The continuation workflow updates feature4 (grandchild) recursively
#   - Verify the label is removed, base updated, branch deleted, and feature4 is updated
#
# Grandchild Update (feature4):
#   - Tests that update_branch_recursive properly handles grandchildren
#   - Even when SQUASH_COMMIT is undefined (in conflict-resolved mode)
#   - The skip_if_clean guard must handle the missing SQUASH_COMMIT ref

# SCENARIO 0: Diff Pollution Test (without action)
# =============================================================================
# This scenario proves that without the action, PR diffs become polluted
# when the base branch is deleted and GitHub auto-retargets to main.
#
# We enable the "auto-delete head branches" repo setting, which causes GitHub
# to atomically handle both branch deletion and PR retargeting when a PR is
# merged. (Note: using `gh pr merge --delete-branch` doesn't trigger auto-retarget
# reliably - it must be the repo setting.)
#
# This causes the child PR's diff to show accumulated changes instead of
# just its own incremental changes - the "broken" state we want to demonstrate.

# --- SCENARIO 3: Sibling Conflicts (Multiple PRs from same base, both conflict) ---
# ===================================================================================
# Tests that the old base branch is kept until ALL sibling PRs resolve their conflicts.
#
# Setup:
#   - Create a new stack: main <- feature5 <- (feature6, feature7) parallel children
#   - feature6 and feature7 both modify line 5 of file.txt
#   - main modifies line 5 differently (creating conflict with both siblings)
#
# Expected Behavior:
#   - After merging feature5, both feature6 and feature7 have conflicts
#   - feature5 branch is kept (referenced by both conflicted PRs)
#   - After resolving feature6, feature5 is still kept (feature7 still conflicted)
#   - After resolving feature7, feature5 is deleted (no more conflicted siblings)
# ===================================================================================
